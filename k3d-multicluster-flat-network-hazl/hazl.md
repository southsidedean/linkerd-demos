# High Availability Zonal Load Balancing (HAZL)

**High Availability Zonal Load Balancing (HAZL)** is a dynamic request-level load balancer in **Buoyant Enterprise for Linkerd** that balances **HTTP** and **gRPC** traffic in environments with **multiple availability zones**. For Kubernetes clusters deployed across multiple zones, **HAZL** can **dramatically reduce cloud spend by minimizing cross-zone traffic**.

Unlike other zone-aware options that use **Topology Hints** (including **Istio** and open source **Linkerd**), **HAZL** _never sacrifices reliability to achieve this cost reduction_.

In **multi-zone** environments, **HAZL** can:

- **Cut cloud spend** by eliminating cross-zone traffic both within and across cluster boundaries;
- **Improve system reliability** by distributing traffic to additional zones as the system comes under stress;
- **Prevent failures before they happen** by quickly reacting to increases in latency before the system begins to fail.
- **Preserve zone affinity for cross-cluster calls**, allowing for cost reduction in multi-cluster environments.

Like **Linkerd** itself, **HAZL** is designed to _"just work"_. It works without operator involvement, can be applied to any Kubernetes service that speaks **HTTP** / **gRPC** regardless of the number of endpoints or distribution of workloads and traffic load across zones, and in the majority of cases _requires no tuning or configuration_.

### How High Availability Zonal Load Balancing (HAZL) Works

For every endpoint, **HAZL** maintains a set of data that includes:

- The **zone** of the endpoint
- The **cost** associated with that zone
- The **recent latency** of responses to that endpoint
- The **recent failure rate** of responses to that endpoint

For every service, **HAZL** continually computes a load metric measuring the utilization of the service. When load to a service falls outside the acceptable range, whether through failures, latency, spikes in traffic, or any other reason, **HAZL** dynamically adds additional endpoints from other zones. When load returns to normal, **HAZL** automatically shrinks the load balancing pool to just in-zone endpoints.

In short: under normal conditions, **HAZL** keeps all traffic within the zone, but when the system is under stress, **HAZL** will temporarily allow cross-zone traffic until the system returns to normal. We'll see this in the **HAZL** demonstration.

**HAZL** will also apply these same principles to cross-cluster / multi-cluster calls: it will preserve zone locality by default, but allow cross-zone traffic if necessary to preserve reliability.

## High Availability Zonal Load Balancing (HAZL) vs Topology Hints

**HAZL** was designed in response to limitations seen by customers using Kubernetes's native **Topology Hints** (aka **Topology-aware Routing**) mechanism. These limitations are shared by native Kubernetes balancing (**kubeproxy**) as well as systems such as open source **Linkerd** and **Istio** that make use of **Topology Hints** to make routing decisions.

Within these systems, the endpoints for each service are allocated ahead of time to specific zones by the **Topology Hints** mechanism. This distribution is done at the Kubernetes API level, and attempts to allocate endpoints within the same zone (but note this behavior isn't guaranteed, and the Topology Hints mechanism may allocate endpoints from other zones). Once this allocation is done, it is static until endpoints are added or removed. It does not take into account traffic volumes, latency, or service health (except indirectly, if failing endpoints get removed via health checks).

Systems that make use of **Topology Hints**, including **Linkerd** and **Istio**, use this allocation to decide where to send traffic. This accomplishes the goal of keeping traffic within a zone but at the expense of reliability: **Topology Hints** itself provides no mechanism for sending traffic across zones if reliability demands it. The closest approximation in (some of) these systems are manual failover controls that allow the operator to failover traffic to a new zone.

Finally, **Topology Hints** has a set of well-known constraints, including:

- It does not work well for services where a large proportion of traffic originates from a subset of zones.
- It does not take into account tolerations, unready nodes, or nodes that are marked as control plane or master nodes.
- It does not work well with autoscaling. The autoscaler may not respond to increases in traffic, or respond by adding endpoints in other zones.
- No affordance is made for cross-cluster traffic.

These constraints have real-world implications. As one customer put it when trying **Istio** + **Topology Hints**: "What we are seeing in _some_ applications is that they won’t scale fast enough or at all (because maybe two or three pods out of 10 are getting the majority of the traffic and is not triggering the HPA) and _can cause a cyclic loop of pods crashing and the service going down_."
